The package `streetelement` has some JavaScript classes about `GTFS` to use in the web browser, plotting data on map, it uses [OpenLayers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ol) to visualize data, and define some functions to interact with GTFS tables, it makes the edition of these elements easier to contain when those features are part of an GTFS web-editor.
